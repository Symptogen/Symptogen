/**
IND_Animation objects are loaded trough the methods of IND_AnimationManager. In order to load
an animation it is necessary to create an animation script in xml format. The structure of the script is quite
easy to understand.

In each animation script you first define the frames (each of the sprites) that you will use for
the sequences that you want to create. Later, you create sequences, using references to these frames,
and specifying the time delay between frames.

So, you can set different sequences using the same frames.

The schema of one animation would be as follows:

\code
Animation
{
    Frames {Frame_1, Frame_2, Frame_3... Frame_n}

    Sequences
    {
        Sequence_1 (list of n frames)
        Sequence_2 (list of n frames)
        Sequence_3 (list of n frames)
        ...
        Sequence_n
    }
}
\endcode

The  @b tokens or <b>keywords</b> of a @b IndieLib animation file are:

<b><< Relative to frames >></b>

@arg <b>\<frames\></b>                Frame section
@arg <b>\<name\></b>                  Name assigned to the frames (later it will be used in the sequences).
@arg <b>\<file\></b>                  Path to the image file.
@arg <b>\<offset_x\></b>              X offset of the frame.    (Optional, 0 by default).
@arg <b>\<offset_y\></b>              Y offset of the frame.    (Optional, 0 by default).

<b><< Relative to sequences >></b>

@arg <b>\<sequences\></b>             Indicates that the sequences are going to be defined in the section between brackets.
@arg <b>\<name\></b>                  Name assigned to the sequence.
@arg <b>\<frame name\></b>            Name of the frame that we are refering to. Here we have to use one of the names we assigned to the loaded frames.
@arg <b>\<time\></b>                  Time, in milliseconds, that the frame will be displayed. (Optional, 150 by default).

@b Note: "//"  can be used before a phrase for writing comments.
